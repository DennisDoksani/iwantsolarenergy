            <article class="article1"><h3>Solar Panels.</h3> Solar Panels nowadays are one of the most used and greatest sources of energy humans come up with. That's because there was never found a source of energy being that reciprocating and fully ecological at the same time. Furthermore, not only that but the product which creates solar energy: which are the solar panels, of course, are cheap enough for their capabilities. Last but not least, let's not forget that solar panels for the crisis our planet is dealing these last years: serious climate changes, the Ozon problem etc... such source of energy must be 100% used immediately.

            <article class="article2"><h3>Charge Controller.</h3> Charge controllers are basically devices which controls when the device will be fully satisfied with power (electrical). Nowadays charge controllers are devices which are more usually used than the previous decade, and that because of the technology devoloping every year that passes rapidly. This though can be an example of a good sign cause that simply means that people nowadays are truely more into ecological sources of power: like solar energy, because they know that this wont only help their planet from getting destroyed due to the phenomenon climate changes, but also will make them as well more happy about their great achievement.</article>
            <article class="article3"><h3>Battery system.</h3>Battery, are simple 'devices' let's call them that really brought an evolution to the human life. By inventing cars,flashes,and short power sources. This way humans thought of evolving this creation by making the batteries not only once usable as they used and still use to be, but making them able to re-charge them with power as before. This idea changed even more this world because this way someone can have unlimited source of power(at least for as long as our star in our solar sytem-'SUN'- will survive) by pushing technology to replace power sources like disel, with big batteries with huge power, capable to re-charge.</article>
            <article class="article4"> <h3>DC power.</h3>Direct current (DC) is the one directional or unidirectional flow of electric charge. An electrochemical cell is a prime example of DC power. Direct current may flow through a conductor such as a wire, but can also flow through semiconductors, insulators, or even through a vacuum as in electron or ion beams. The electric current flows in a constant direction, distinguishing it from alternating current (AC). A term formerly used for this type of current was galvanic current.The abbreviations AC and DC are often used to mean simply alternating and direct, as when they modify current or voltage. </article>
            <article class="article5"><h3>Inverter.</h3>Solar inverters are the hardest-working component of a solar array, as PV Evolution Labs (PVEL) described in its inaugural “PV Inverter Scorecard.”Inverters are solely responsible for more operational functions than any other PV system component. These duties have continued to grow as systems get smarter and increase interaction with the utility grid. The basic function of an inverter is to convert the direct current (DC) power that solar panels create to alternating current (AC) power that is usable in homes and businesses or fed directly into the grid in front-of-the-meter projects (utility-scale solar arrays).</article>
            <article class="article6"><h3>AC power</h3>Alternating current (AC) is an electric current that periodically reverses its direction, in contrast to direct current (DC) which only flows in a single direction which cannot change sporadically. The portion of power that, averaged over a complete cycle of the AC waveform, results in a net transfer of energy in one direction is known as active power (more commonly called real power to avoid ambiguity especially in discussions of loads with non-sinusoidal currents). The portion of power due to stored energy, which returns to the source in each cycle, is known as instantaneous reactive power, and its amplitude is the absolute value of reactive power.</article>
